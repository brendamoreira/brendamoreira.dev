    Soft skills:
    <div>
      I'm a very hard-working, dedicated and disciplinated self-taught
      developer. I've been doing some courses since I've moved to the
      Netherlands. I'm very good in communicating and expressing myself. I
      consider myself a good learner but also know my limitations. I'll do my
      best to make each second count on every task I work on, also knowing when
      it's time to ask for help. Im very passionate about development in
      general. I can also set priorities on what to learn next and I'm willing
      to learn different tech stacks.
